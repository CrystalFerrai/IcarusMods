# Crystal's Icarus Mod Releases

This folder contains the latest downloadable releases for all of the mods.

# Usage

Mods need to be installed using [Icarus Mod Manager](https://github.com/CrystalFerrai/IcarusModManager). Once installed, just play the game and enjoy. Whenever the game updates, run the mod manager and press the install button to integrate the mods with the latest game data. The mods themselves do not need to be updated most of the time, only installed again.

If you play with other mods not designed for the mod manager, it is recommended that you load them into the mod manager anyway. Then, place any of my mods after those to ensure they merge properly. Failure to do this may result in conflicts between mod manager mods and other mods.

# Mod Details

## Deep Ore Fast

Increases the mining speed of the biofuel and electric deep ore mining drills.

## Exotic Spawner

Spawns 3 exotics veins in open world propsects containing 200-400 exotics each at random locations. Once a vein is fully emptied, another one will automatically spawn a short while later (10 minutes or less) at a new location. Once all possible vein locations have spawned - there are around 70 per map - new veins will stop spawning.

**This mod only functions in open world prospects, not missions or outposts.**

You can press F7 to access a menu with advanced commands. From here, you can clear the map of all radar scans to clean up after many scans have been completed. You can also remove all depleted exotics veins, allowing new ones to later spawn in their place. These commands work regardless whether you are in an open world prospect or not. However, new veins will only spawn in open world.

## Hide Geometry Screen

Prevents the game from displaying the "Preparing Geometry" screen, allowing you to see things loading in behind it. Intended to help people diagnose cases where the screen gets stuck and never closes.

## Info Mod

This mod assists with gathering information about things in the game world. This is primarily intended to assist with data mining and bug reporting efforts.

The mod will display your current character position and rotation at the top left of the screen. This display can be toggled off/on by pressing \[Ctrl + Numpad 6\].

Pressing \[Numpad 6\] will perform a scan for locations and other details of various objects in the world and open a fullscreen overlay showing the results. This overlay auto-refreshes data every 10 seconds while it remains open. It also provides buttons to toggle location markers for objects on the game map and compass. (This overlay only functions if the mod is installed by the current host or dedicated server.)

Pressing \[Alt + Numpad 6\] will start a continuous scan of whatever your game camera is currently looking at. It will display some information in the middle of your screen about your target such as actor class and material type.

Warning: Do not run the game without this mod if any of your loadouts or dropships currently have more than 15 items in them as the extra items may be lost.

## More Power
Increases power output and lowers fuel consumption for generators.

**Power Output**

* Biofuel generator: 5000 -> 10000
* Waterwheel: 2000 -> 5000

## No Plant Fatigue
Removes plant fatigue from crop plots for all plants except "strange plants". Note that the Fatigue debuff will still appear, but it will stay at -100%, meaning it does not do anything.

## Red Exotics Mission

Adds a new mission to the Prometheus map called "HARVEST: Red Exotics". This is an exploration mission (30 days, no objectives) that is accessible after completing the fourth story mission. This new mission contains 10 red exotic trees for harvesting.
