# Crystal's Icarus Mods

A collection of mods created by me for the survival game Icarus.

# Usage

Mods need to be installed using [Icarus Mod Manager](https://github.com/CrystalFerrai/IcarusModManager). Once installed, just play the game and enjoy. Whenever the game updates, run the mod manager and press the install button to integrate the mods with the latest game data. The mods themselves do not need to be updated most of the time, only installed again.

If you play with other mods not designed for the mod manager, it is recommended that you load them into the mod manager anyway. Then, place any of my mods after those to ensure they merge properly. Failure to do this may result in conflicts between mod manager mods and other mods.

# Mod Details

## Loadout

Increases loadout and drop ship slots from 15 to 20.

Warning: Do not run the game without this mod if any of your loadouts or dropships currently have more than 15 items in them as the extra items may be lost.

## Deep Ore Fast

Increases the mining speed of the biofuel and electric deep ore mining drills.

* Biofuel drill: +0% -> +75%
* Electric drill: +33% -> +100%

## Exotic Spawner

Spawns 3 exotics veins in open world propsects containing 200-400 exotics each at random locations. Once a vein is fully emptied, another one will automatically spawn a short while later (10 minutes or less) at a new location. Once all possible vein locations have spawned - there are around 70 per map - new veins will stop spawning.

**This mod only functions in open world prospects, not missions or outposts.**

You can press F7 to access a menu with advanced commands. From here, you can clear the map of all radar scans to clean up after many scans have been completed. You can also remove all depleted exotics veins, allowing new ones to later spawn in their place. These commands work regardless whether you are in an open world prospect or not. However, new veins will only spawn in open world.

## Lantern Fuel
Inrcreases the fuel that a lantern can hold from 1000 to 2500 and increases the biofuel lamp fuel from 2000 to 2500 to match the lantern.

## More Power
Increases power output and lowers fuel consumption for generators.

**Power Output**

* Biofuel generator: 5000 -> 10000
* Waterwheel: 2000 -> 5000
* Solar panel: 5000 -> 10000

**Fuel Consumption**

A full can of biofuel will last 8 hours 20 minutes in a generator, double the vanilla time of 4 hours 10 minutes.

## No Plant Fatigue
Removes plant fatigue from crop plots for all plants except "strange plants". Note that the Fatigue debuff will still appear, but it will stay at -100%, meaning it does not do anything.
