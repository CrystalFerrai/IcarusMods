# Crystal's Icarus Mods

A collection of mods created by me for the survival game Icarus.

## Usage

Mods need to be installed using [Icarus Mod Manager](https://github.com/CrystalFerrai/IcarusModManager). Once installed, just play the game and enjoy. Whenever the game updates, run the mod manager and press the install button to integrate the mods with the latest game data. The mods themselves do not need to be updated most of the time, only installed again.

If you play with other mods not designed for the mod manager, it is recommended that you load them into the mod manager anyway. Then, place any of my mods after those to ensure they merge properly. Failure to do this may result in conflicts between mod manager mods and other mods.

## Mod Details
